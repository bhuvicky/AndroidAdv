Reason 1 = = > > to check lifecycle of Activity:

while go from Activity-A to Activity-B & comeback from B to A

A to B
I/System.out: ActivityA OnCreate
I/System.out: ActivityA onStart
I/System.out: ActivityA onResume
I/System.out: ActivityA onPause
I/System.out: ActivityB OnCreate
I/System.out: ActivityB onStart
I/System.out: ActivityB onResume
I/System.out: ActivityA onStop

B to A
I/System.out: log BSC after pop = 0
I/System.out: ActivityB onPause
I/System.out: ActivityA onRestart
I/System.out: ActivityA onStart
I/System.out: ActivityA onResume
I/System.out: ActivityB onStop
I/System.out: ActivityB onDestroy


Reason 2 = = > > to check whether v can create an Activity without UI ??.

I/System.out: FragmentA1 onAttach
I/System.out: FragmentA1 OnCreate

I/System.out: FragmentA1 onStart
I/System.out: FragmentA1 onResume
I/System.out: log FragmentB BSC = 1

Fragment A to B; "ADD" Transaction life cycle

I/System.out: FragmentB1 onAttach
I/System.out: FragmentB1 OnCreate
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onCreateView
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onViewCreated
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onStart
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onResume

B to A
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onPause
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onStop
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onDestroyView
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onDestroy
I/System.out: FragmentB1 onDetach

Note: observe while going from A to B & B to A, no lifecyle of A gets called.
so, v have to check whether v can pass data from B to A

Yes. v can able to pass data from B to A using interface as usual......

I/System.out: FragmentB1 back pressed
I/System.out: FragmentA1 data passed from B to A
